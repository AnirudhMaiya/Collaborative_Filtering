# Collaborative_Filtering
Simple implementation of CF using Keras.<br>

Dataset used:
MovieLens 1M dataset.

Some implementations:
1) User-User similarity was found out using Cosine similarity
2) Embedding based Neural Network to predict ratings.
   a) Model 1 has mean absolute error of 0.723618
   b) Model 2 has mean absolute error of 0.701187

Future Work:
1) Implementing Prof Andrew Ng's method of CF taught in Coursera's Machine Learning Course in python.
